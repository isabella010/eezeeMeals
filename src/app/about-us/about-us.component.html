    <!--<h2>About Us</h2> -->
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eezee Meals was founded in 2022 by a group of food enthusiasts who wanted to make it easier for people to eat healthy and delicious meals. They realized that many people struggle to find the time and energy to cook, and often end up ordering unhealthy fast food or relying on processed meals.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, the founders set out to create a meal delivery service that would provide fresh, wholesome meals that are easy to prepare and taste great. They decided to use the MEAN data stack to build their platform, which allowed them to create a robust and scalable system that could handle the demands of a growing customer base.</p>

    <h2>What is MEAN?</h2>
    <p>MEAN is an acronym that stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. These are all open-source technologies that are commonly used for building web applications. Here's what each of them does:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MongoDB</strong>: a document-oriented database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Express</strong>: a web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of tools for building web applications, including middleware, routing, and template engines.</li>
      <li><strong>Angular</strong>: a front-end framework that provides a powerful set of tools for building dynamic web applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Node.js</strong>: a server-side JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance web applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By using the MEAN stack, the founders of Eezee Meals were able to create a platform that is fast, reliable, and easy to use. They were also able to take advantage of the many benefits of open-source technology, including a large community of developers, a wealth of resources and tools, and the ability to customize and extend the platform as needed.</p>
