This project's goal is to create a website for local meal kit delivery service. It will allow customers to create accounts and choose pre-set meals, which will be delivered to their address. It's pay-per-order as opposed to meal scheduler because this will allow more customization and freedom for the customers and their preferences. This will include a cart for customers to accumulate meals and purchase them as well as meal designers and admin accounts where they are able to update the meals and manage them as well. There will also be a meal count and ingredient count to keep track of meal stock and ingredients. 

We will be using MongoDB for the database system, Express for back end, Angular for front end, NODE for a runtime environment, and Bootstrap for CSS designing.
