# Back-End
In back-end, we will be using MongoDB for our database to store user account information like username and password. 

# Front-End
In front-end, we will use Express and Node will be used to host the website on a server. We will use Angular to create the users interface such as home page, user log in/register page, the cart, meal list page, and profile settings page and Bootstrap for the appearance/styling of our website.  

# Developing Tools
This website will be developed using Visual Studio Code with Angular, Express, Node, and Bootstrap. We will be using Postman to test HTTP requests to ensure both front-end and back-end work together.
