# 1. Introduction:
This website will allow customers to create accounts and choose pre-set meals, which will be delivered to their address. It's pay-per-order as opposed to meal scheduler because this will allow more customization and freedom for the customers and their preferences. Each meal will be added to the users cart and when done so, the stock count of the item will decrease by the quantity the user chooses to purchase. This web application will also include meal designer and admin accounts (who also schedules meals). A notification system will be created to notify admin when meals are low in stock. Admin can then either modify the meal count or remove the item from the menu (which they can then add a new item  if they wish to add it back).
